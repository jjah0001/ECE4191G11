1. fix encoder reading speed
	- try to fix multithreading, set prio?
		- not sure if possible'
		- in theory just a better solution...
		- try this first, then 

	- move encoder back into its own separate ros2 node
		- adds back delay (~50ms?)
		- PID:
			- move back into separate node, but keep pid speed control in movement loop?
				- will have one thread perma updating encoder counts + publishing instead of just updating
				- will also need a subscriber to constantly listen to values
				- approx 1.5x more thread usage?


2. speed up path planning (can test without robot)
	- using D* instead?

3. localisation implementation/ideas (can start coding without robot)
	- implement compass sensor
	- limit switches?

4. fix ultrasonic bug

5. communications (can implement without robot, must do with partner team)
