A: Path planning:
	1. Make path smoother DONE
	2. Fix obstacles in vis DONE
	3. Try path planning with other robot DONE

B: Localisation:
	1. Implement limit switch for delivery DONE
	2. Implement limit switch for re-localisation DONE

C: PID:
	1. redo PID if needed

D: Encoder:
	0. Make movement accurate, calibrate  <---------
	1. Look into multiprocessing, reuse old code # DONE
	2. Implement PID? 

E: Communications:
	1. Implement communications into path planner 
		- box out partner loading zone DONE
		- can get pose
			- trying to replan path if partner bot pose intersects with our pathDONE
		- make path planner wait and retry if no path can be found (keyError), DONE
		
		- need to stop the robot when path is obstructed and replanning path.. DONE
		
		- straighten path using new check intersection function (add onto smooth path)  DONE
		- Add in functionaility for avoiding partner bot's planned path as well.
			- will need to code the situation where the other robot paths through us, somehow move out of the way <-----
			
F: VIS
	1. draw partner robot path <-----
	2. draw red regions where path planner considers obs? <-----
		- draw using segments
