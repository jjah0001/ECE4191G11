# ECE4191 Engineering Integrated Design Group 11
This repository includes all the scripts that are used to code the robot. The main interface for the robot would be the RaspberryPi and the main language of code is Python.

## Implementation
The group has decided to use ROS for the project and an AStar path planning method. This would ensure that the robot would be able to communicate properly with the computer and avoid an obstacle easily if detected. The robot is also meant to communicate with other robots. In this case, Bluetooth will be used to do so.

The mission of the robot is to deliver packages into certain bins. As such, QR Codes would be attached onto the parcels and is scanned by the robot to determine where it should go.

## Robot
The robot was designed extensively using Solidworks with a customised baseplate, ramp and its support. Using an R2D2 hinge, the robot would be able to deliver the packages by opening a door. The robot is decorated with the Chinese characters "十一", meaning eleven in Chinese.
